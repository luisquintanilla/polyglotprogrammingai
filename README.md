# PolyglotProgrammingAI

PolyglotProgrammingAI is a project that demonstrates the integration of various programming languages and AI capabilities within a single interactive environment. It leverages .NET Interactive, Semantic Kernel, and Z3 theorem prover to create a powerful and flexible development experience.

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter notebooks with multiple language support
- AI-powered code generation and problem-solving
- Integration with Azure OpenAI services
- Custom Prompty kernel for AI interactions
- Z3 theorem prover integration for mathematical problem-solving

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. Interactive.Prompty: A custom kernel for AI interactions
2. Sample notebooks: Demonstrating various capabilities of the system
3. Z3 integration: For solving mathematical and logical problems

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your Azure OpenAI credentials in the environment variables
3. Open the sample notebooks (sample.ipynb and z3.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment that supports .NET Interactive

## Key Components

### Interactive.Prompty

This is a custom kernel that allows for AI-powered interactions within the notebook environment. It includes:

- PromptyKernel: Handles prompty configurations and fluent prompt templates
- PromptyOrchestratorKernel: Orchestrates AI interactions using Azure OpenAI

### Z3 Integration

The project incorporates Z3, a theorem prover from Microsoft Research, to solve complex mathematical and logical problems. Examples can be found in the z3.ipynb notebook.

### Sample Notebooks

1. sample.ipynb: Demonstrates basic prompty interactions and weather function integration
2. z3.ipynb: Showcases Z3 theorem prover usage for solving various problems
